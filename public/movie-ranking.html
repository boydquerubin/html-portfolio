<h1>Boyd's Favorite Movies</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Interview with the Vampire</h3>
<p>I love the character creation, pacing and story telling in this movie. It has great acting and amazing set design.</p>

<h3>The Lord of the Rings (Trilogy)</h3>

<p>These are probably the best made movies of all time. <br />
It's a trilogy, I can't choose any of the three so I am lumping all of them in one. <br />
They used real humans with prosthetics, mixed with CGI, which I thought made the movies that much better. <br />
Classic movie about Good and Evil, friend and foe, action, romance, comedy, it has it all. <br /></p>


<h3>Jojo Rabbit</h3>

<p>I had to watch this for one of my college humanities classes, and it made an impression on me at that specific point in my life.<br />
 The mixture of comedy set in a serious time period of World War II, worked for me.<br />
 I usually have a hard time watching movies set in the World Wars, but this movie was a really good watch.<br /></p>
